#Exeter Connect
Exeter Connect is PEA's implementation of Microsoft SharePoint 2010.
"connect.exeter.edu" will refer to the web frontend to Exeter Connect, or what people normally refer to as "Exeter Connect".

Upon login on connect.exeter.edu, your browser makes multiple SOAP calls to Connect's Web Services via XHR to provide you with your data: to populate your courses, your classmate photos, etc. You can check it out in the "network" window in your browser's developer tools.
